This repository contains my personal portfolio website, which showcases my academic background, technical skills, and major projects. Visitors can easily navigate the site using the menu at the top, with links to the Home, About, Projects, Resume, and Contact pages. The website is styled using CSS and is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile. I also included a virtual assistant chatbot using Dialogflow, which is embedded through a floating chatbot widget. The chatbot helps users by answering questions about me, my education, career goals, contact options, and key projects. Documents such as my résumé and project presentations can be viewed or downloaded directly from the site, and a QR code is available for quick access on mobile devices. The website is hosted using GitHub Pages, with all assets stored inside the appropriate folders in this repository.
